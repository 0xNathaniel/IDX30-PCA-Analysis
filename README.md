## Introduction

This project explores the effectiveness of PCA in identifying systematic and idiosyncratic risks in IDX30 stocks. By analyzing principal components, this study aims to:
- Uncover key risk factors affecting portfolio performance.
- Construct portfolios with varying risk and return profiles.
- Compare portfolio performances based on different PCA-driven weightings.

The research highlights PCA as a tool for risk management and diversification while emphasizing its limitations in guaranteeing superior returns.

## Features

- **PCA Implementation:** Perform PCA on IDX30 stock returns to extract principal components and explained variance.
- **Portfolio Construction:** Create portfolios using:
  - Top principal components (PC1, Top 3 PCs, etc.)
  - 95% variance portfolio
  - Equal weight portfolio
  - Custom weight portfolio
- **Risk Analysis:** Assess stock loadings and their contributions to systematic and specific risks.
- **Visualization:** Generate graphs for cumulative returns, explained variance, stock loadings, and portfolio weights.

## Results
- **Key Insights**
  - Portfolios constructed with broader principal components exhibited better diversification and risk mitigation.
  - Custom weight portfolios demonstrated the potential for superior returns when aligned with strategic investment goals.
- **Limitations**
  - PCA alone does not guarantee superior performance; combining it with economic and strategic factors is recommended.
